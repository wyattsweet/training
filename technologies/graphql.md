# GraphQL
Notes from [the documentation.](https://graphql.org/learn/)

## Introduction

GraphQL is a query language for your API and a server side runtime for executing queries.

The backend GraphQL services is created by defining types and fields on those types.

```
type Query {
  me: User
}

type User {
  id: ID
  name: String
}
```

A graphQL service is running, it can be sent graphQL queries. It will first validate the query for the proper field and types, then runs the function and returns the result.

The following query

```
{
  me {
    name 
  }
}
```

Could produce the following JSON result

```json
{
  "me": {
    "name": "Luke Skywalker"
  }
}
```

## Queries & Mutations

How to query a GraphQL server

### Fields

GraphQL is about asking for specific fields on objects. The query has the same shape as the response, you always get back what you expect. Fields can refer to strings or you can make a sub-selection of fields which refers to an object

```
{
  hero {
    name
    friends {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

which would return â€“

```json
{
  "data": {
    "hero": {
      "name": "R2-D2",
      "friends": [
        {
          "name": "Luke Skywalker"
        },
        {
          "name": "Han Solo"
        },
        {
          "name": "Leia Organa"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Arguments

You can pass arguments to fields.

```
{
  human(id: '1000') {
    name
    height
  }
}
``` 

```json
{
  "data": {
    "human": {
      "name": "Luke Skywalker",
      "heigth": 1.72 
    }
  }
}
```

Every field and nested set of arguments can get its own argument. You can pass arguments to do data transformations on the server, instead of on every client.

```
{
  human(id: '1000') {
    name
    height(unit: FOOT)
  }
}
``` 

```json
{
  "data": {
    "human": {
      "name": "Luke Skywalker",
      "heigth": 5.876453 
    }
  }
}
```

Arguments can be many different types. This example uses a enumeration type, which represents one of a finite set of options. GraphQL comes with a default list of types, but a GraphQL server can declare its own types. 

### Aliases

When you write a graphQL query the response key value has the same name as query. If two fields in an object are going to conflict because they have the same name, you can use an alias to change the name of the field in the response object. This lets you fetch all the data with one request and not have to worry about conflicting fields.

*query with alias*
```
{
  empireHero: hero(episode: EMPIRE) {
    name
  }
  jediHero: hero(episode: JEDI) {
    name
  }
}
```

*JSON response*

```
{
  "data": {
    "empireHero": {
      "name": "Luke SKywalker"
    },
    "JediHero": {
      "name": "R2-D2"
    }
  }
}
```

### Fragments

Fragments let you set up groups of fields that can be reused across multiple queries. This let's you keep your queries DRY and saves you from having to re-write lists of fields.

*example query with fragments*

```
leftComparison: hero(episode: EMPIRE) {
  ...comparisonFields
}

rightComparison: hero(episode: JEDI) {
  ...comparisonFields
}

fragment comparisonFields on Character {
  name
  appearsIn
  frields {
    name
  }
} 
```

*JSON response*

```json
{
  "data": {
    "leftComparison": {
      "name": "Luke Skywalker",
      "appearsIn": [
        "NEWHOPE",
        "EMPIRE",
        "JEDI"
      ],
      "friends": [
        {
          "name": "Han Solo"
        },
        {
          "name": "Leia Organa"
        },
        {
          "name": "C-3PO"
        },
        {
          "name": "R2-D2"
        }
      ]
    },
    "rightComparison": {
      "name": "R2-D2",
      "appearsIn": [
        "NEWHOPE",
        "EMPIRE",
        "JEDI"
      ],
      "friends": [
        {
          "name": "Luke Skywalker"
        },
        {
          "name": "Han Solo"
        },
        {
          "name": "Leia Organa"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
```

### Operation Name

Up until this point, the examples have used a shorthand syntax which leaves out the `query` keyword and the query name. In production apps, it's useful to use these to make code less ambiguous.

*example query with query keyword and query name*

```
query HeroNameAndFrields {
  hero {
    name
    frields {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

The **operation type** is either `query`, `mutation` or `subscription`. This is required when not using the query shorthand. 

**operation name** is similar to a function name and aids when trying to debug. It's much easier to debug a query that's failing if you get a name in your logs as opposed to trying to decipher based on the content.

### Variables

GraphQL has a first-class way to factor dynamic values out of the query and pass them in a separate dictionary. These values are called variables 

When working with variables
1. Replace the static files with `$variableName`
- Declare `$variableName`
- Pass `variableName: value` in the separate dictionary. This will be transport specific (usually JSON)

```
query HeroNameAndFriends($episode: Episode) {
  hero(episode: $episode) {
    name
    friends {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

*variable*
```
{
  "episode": "JEDI"
}
```

You should never use string interpolation to construct queries

### Variable Definition

The variable definition is the `$episode: Episode` part in the query above. This is just like argument definitions for functions in a typed language. The variable is listed, `$episode`, followed by its type `Episode`.
Declared variables must be either `scalars`, `enums` or `input` object types. If you want to pass a complex object, you need to know which input type matches on the server.

Variables can be optional or required. In the example above a `!` would be used next to the `Episode` type to denote it's a required field.

### Default Variables

Default variables can be assigned to variables like so

```
query HeroNameAndFriends($episode: Episode = 'JEDI') { ... }
```

When variables are passed in, they will override the default
