### Cover Letter Components

cover letter should be
- intro
- 2 to 3 body paragraphs

Pick a job that interests you, one you're qualified for but even better pick your ideal job even if you need to develop more skills before you can pursue it. This allows you to pinpoint areas you need to develop.

Look at description and notice the skills you have and are exceptionally good at and the skills you may not have.

### Write the Introduction

Include your purpose and professional mission.
Include the name of the organization and the title of the job your applying to, usually in the first sentence.
**Focus less on why the company should want you and more on why you want the company. This is vital, your statement of interest is unique to you and helps you stand out.**

An example if you were applying to a finance company

> "I am a passionate data analyst fascinated by the opportunities created by the abundance of available data and computing power in the modern accounting industry."

All jobs and companies are different and you should take a different approach to each of them.

### Write the Body

Break these into categories around the different functions the job requires. Focus in on the things you're especially good at, If you're an expert in one thing, the employer can make a logical conclusion that you can learn and become an expert in something else. Use the cover letter to make a case for yourself for skills you don't have.

Should include concrete examples of your related experience â€“ describe an experience in detail

> "I recently built a website for members of a national organization. Some of the website features included an appointment scheduler that factors in time zone differences and a searchable online drive of meeting notes."

This shows you can develop multiple types of website features, meet the needs of a client, you can develop with user experience of interface design in mind.

Expand on this describing which languages and frameworks you used. One detailed example is better than having 5 general sentences about skills. Give examples on when you achieved a lot of great success or when you worked on a team and were challenged to do something you've never done before. You can also reinforce goals and how they align with the position.

### Write the Conclusion

Shortest paragraph and hiring managers last impression of you. Briefly restate why you want and why you're a good fit for this job. Include any logistics, such as if you were out of town. Thank the recruiter for their time and consideration. Humility and gratitude can go a long way.

### Final

Make sure the formatting looks good.
Use 1 inch margins
include date (Month day, year), include an address, address letter to the recruiter if name is available or "Dear Engineering Team" or "Dear Recruiting Team". Include a formal salutations. Such as:

Best Regards,
