# Build a Personal Brand Online

### Elevator Pitch

Develop an elevator pitch: 
1. What do you want employers to know about you?
- What are you most proud of?

Example â€“

> "Hi, I'm chris, a full stack software engineer who loves building education products. I recently developed a web app using AngularJS that lets teachers share student writing samples anonymously. I'd love to combine my passion for learning and teaching with my software development skills to continue building personalized learning products for people."

Pitch could be linkedin summary, but when you talk to somebody you naturally communicate points.

Employers look for candidates on platforms such as Github, Medium, Twitter, etc.
